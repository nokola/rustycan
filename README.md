# Goals
- Simple to use
- Easy to create UIs and update existing UIs
- High performance
- Easy to style
- Easy to extend
- Hot reload
- Advanced effects - blur, frosted glass, shaders
- Animation
- Accessibility
- Supports both immediate and retained modes
- Themes
- Cross-platform on Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, Web
- Native controls support

Rustycan aims to achieve the goals above by reinventing the UI syntax and tools, while relying on existing frameworks (either low-level or other UI frameworks for rendering.)
That enables me to focus on ergonomics instead of reinventing much of the rendering stack.
